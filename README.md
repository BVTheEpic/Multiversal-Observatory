# Multiversal-Observatory
A program allowing users to observe all 52 worlds of the DC Multiverse.
When you first open the program, there will be pop-up instructions on how to operate the GUI.
The program is centered around an "Earth" class, and the properties of the 52 objects derived from it.
There are no comments, but the code is fairly straightforward, so it's practically self-documenting.
